# Webscraping Stock Data Extraction and Visualization

## Description

Hi, I'm Eduardo. Welcome to my project repository for the **Python Project for Data Science IBM Certification**. This project is centered around the crucial aspect of data science that is extracting essential data from datasets and visually representing this data to enable informed decision-making. In this particular case, we focus on extracting and visualizing stock data for two significant market players: _Tesla_ and _GameStop_.

The project leverages Python for both webscraping to extract revenue data and utilizing the `yfinance` library to fetch historical stock data. The visualization part is adeptly handled by the `plotly` library, enabling interactive and insightful charts that detail the financial journey of these companies over time.

## Project Objectives

- **Extract Stock Data**: Use `yfinance` to fetch historical data for Tesla and GameStop stocks.
- **Webscraping for Revenue Data**: Apply `BeautifulSoup` to scrape revenue data from the web.
- **Visualize Data**: Employ `plotly` to create interactive graphs that represent stock prices and revenue trends comprehensively.

## Technologies

This project is implemented using:
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **yfinance** for stock data extraction
- **BeautifulSoup** for webscraping
- **Plotly** for interactive data visualization

## Acknowledgements

- Joseph Santarcangelo and Azim Hirjani for their initial work and guidance on this project.
- The `yfinance` and `plotly` libraries for providing the tools necessary to extract and visualize stock data.


Happy Investing!
